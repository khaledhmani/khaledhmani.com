# Google Analytics 4 Setup Instructions

## What's Been Added

Your website now has Google Analytics 4 (GA4) tracking code integrated. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. Basic GA4 Tracking
- Added the GA4 global site tag (gtag.js) to the `<head>` section
- Configured for page view tracking
- Added placeholder for your GA4 Measurement ID

### 2. Enhanced Event Tracking
The following user interactions are now tracked:
- **Contact Events**: Email clicks, phone clicks, copy button usage
- **Social Media Clicks**: LinkedIn and GitHub profile visits
- **Navigation**: Section scrolling and navigation clicks
- **Downloads**: PDF/resume download attempts
- **Interactions**: Skills filter usage

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Your GA4 Measurement ID
1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)
2. Create a new GA4 property (if you don't have one)
3. Get your Measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)

### Step 2: Replace the Placeholder
In your `index.html` file, replace both instances of `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` with your actual Measurement ID:

```html
<!-- Line 69 & 74 in index.html -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
1. Deploy your website
2. Visit your site and interact with various elements
3. Check your GA4 real-time reports to see tracked events

## Tracked Events

| Event Name | Category | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| `email_click` | contact | When someone clicks your email link |
| `phone_click` | contact | When someone clicks your phone number |
| `social_click` | social | LinkedIn/GitHub profile clicks |
| `pdf_download` | download | Resume PDF download attempts |
| `copy_contact` | contact | Copy button usage for contact info |
| `section_navigation` | navigation | Navigation between page sections |
| `skills_filter` | interaction | Skills filter usage |

## Privacy Considerations

The implementation respects user privacy:
- No personal data is collected beyond standard web analytics
- Events track user behavior patterns, not personal information
- Complies with GDPR requirements when properly configured in GA4

## Next Steps

1. Replace the placeholder Measurement ID
2. Set up GA4 goals and conversions based on your objectives
3. Configure audience segments for better insights
4. Set up custom dashboards for key metrics

Your analytics setup is now ready for production use!
